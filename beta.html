							<h5>From Alpha Prototype</h5>
							<p>For the alpha prototype, we introduced some major design changes to our system. One of the major changes was the move from gestural inputs to button inputs. This provided the user more freedom and gave visibility, removing the user’s reliance on their memory. We also made the application compatible with Talkback, which was a major usability criteria when it comes to the visually impaired community.</p>
							<p>For our beta prototype, the design changes we implemented are more subtle but, we believe, improve the user experience, simplify the application and improve our score on Nielsen’s usability criteria. These modifications are based on feedback we obtained from fellow classmates as well as changes we felt were important.</p> 
							<h5>Removal of Main Menu page</h5>
							<p>In our alpha prototype, our design had 3 menus as shown in the images below.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-xs-4">
									<img src="imgs/main-menu.png" width="100%">
								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-4">
									<img src="imgs/intersection-mapping.png" width="100%">
								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-4">
									<img src="imgs/light-detection.png" width="100%">
								</div>
							</div>
							<p></p>
							<p>Explained simply, the alpha version starts in the main menu page where the user can select to enter either the intersection mapping menu or the light detection menu; and the application flows from there (This is further explained in the alpha prototype user manual). However, there is actually no utility provided by this page.</p>
							<p>For this reason, we have “stripped” the application from this page and greatly simplified the application in other menus, as shown below.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-xs-6">
									<img src="imgs/intersect-assist-beta.png" width="100%">
								</div>
								<div class="col-xs-6">
									<img src="imgs/light-detection-in-progress-beta.png" width="100%">
								</div>
							</div>
							<p></p>
							<p>Now, when the application starts, the intersect-assist page shows up showing two buttons. When the user chooses the intersection mapping button, the intersection information is provided via audio, while the application page doesn’t change. When the user chooses the light detection button, the second page starts where a camera detects the light color. When the user completes crossing the road, they are required to click the I’m done button, which takes them back to the original page. This modification relates to Nielsen’s <b>Aesthetics and Minimalist design heuristic.</b></p>
							<h5>Providing the mapping information in a spatial format</h5>
							<p>Our second modification is in the way we provide the mapping information to the user. Initially, when the user prompts the application for the intersection information, the following example message would be outputted:</p>
							<p><i>“Intersection: St-Catherine and Guy, 4-way configuration. St-Catherine is a one-way street, three lanes. Traffic flows in the opposite direction you are facing. Guy is a two-way street, four lanes. The closest two lanes ahead flow from your left to your right. The further two lanes flow from your right to your left.”</i></p> 
							<p>The problem with this structure is in the wording used to provide the spatial information. Additionally, some of the information provided wasn’t found essential by the users during our low-fidelity prototype testing. However, at the time, we thought that keeping it couldn't hurt. However, we have now decided to remove some of that information in order to speed up the delivery of the information. The new message is as follows:</p>
							<p><i>Audio from both ears to simulate information is spatially in front of the user.<br/>
							“Intersection: St-Catherine and Guy, 4-way configuration.”
							<br>

							Audio from the right ear only, indicating to the user that this relates to information from their right.<br>
							“St-Catherine is a one-way street, three lanes.”<br>


							Audio from both ears to simulate the information is spatially in front of the user.<br>
							“Guy is a two-way street, four lanes.”<br>
							</i></p>
							<p>This modification relates to Nielsen’s <b>Match between system and the real world heuristic</b>, since the user can spatially understand how the information relates to the real world without actually having to say where the street is.</p>
							<h5>Addition of feedback when awaiting light status</h5>
							<p>The last modification we implemented in our beta prototype is in the light detection part of the application. In the alpha phase of the application, when the user clicks the light detection section, the application doesn’t inform the user of what it’s doing. We felt that this would cause the user confusion and would not be sure how to proceed. For this reason, we implemented a message that plays every 5 seconds to the user which says: </p>
							<h6 class="text-center">Waiting for light to turn green</h6>
							<p>This modification relates to Nielsen’s <b>Visibility of system status heuristic</b> in that the user will know the status of the application throughout the use of the system.</p>

							<p>The overall architecture of our implementation consist on a smartphone (Android-based) application and a server side component that has the responsibility of doing all the heavy processing related to intersection mapping calculation and traffic light detection. Due to some estimations on the complexity of the feature and the most needed accuracy of an implementation to have a potential value for our users, we decided to remove the veering detection feature from our Beta Prototype. Hence, our Beta Prototype now includes the traffic light detection feature, which was missing from our ALpha release. This feature has brought the following changes to our system archiecture:</p>
							<div class="col-xs-12 text-center"><img src="imgs/architecture.png" width="100%"></div>
							<p>The traffic light detection feature heavily relies of the implementation provided by the <a href="http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">Yolo Darknet</a> reserach project as an starting point for our light detection mechanism. This real-time object detection system provides us with the capability of detection traffic light in daily scenarios. On top of the results provided by this implementation we have created an specific routine to detect the status of the traffic light. At this moment, we do not considered that this feature has been properly tested in enough scenarios to consider it safe for our end users. We expect that in a near future we will be able to run enough test scenarios to bring this application to our potential users. </p>
							<p>The smartphone application we have developed can be downloaded from <a href="">here</a>. If anyone is interested in testing our current Beta Prototype in a real-time scenario, we strongly advise to contact anyone on out team, so we can find a convinient place to deploy our backend server, which is not currently available from a public Internet address.</p>
