						<h2>Problem Statement<small></small></h1>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<p>Two problems have been identified at intersections for the visually impaired community. Please refer to the following image when considering the two problems below.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h4>Mapping the Intersection</h4>
							<p class="text-justify">One problem that was observed is the ability to map an intersection. All of the observed users needed to have a clear map of the intersection in order to feel safe and comfortable crossing the intersection. If they had low vision, they could use the people and traffic to help them map it, provided the intersection is busy with pedestrians and automobiles. If they were completely blind, they needed to use the acoustics of traffic. </p>
							<p class="text-justify">Mapping the intersection entails having information on the shape of the intersection, the number of lanes at each side, the number of stop signs at the intersection and the direction of traffic in which the cars are moving (one-way or two-way). If the intersection is in a familiar neighbourhood, they usually have a clear map. As a result, most visually impaired (VI) people rarely explore new areas. Additionally, if there is anything causing them to detour from the regular route, as is the case in construction times, they will have to rely on someone’s help or attempt to map new intersections.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h4>Crossing the Intersection</h4>
							<p class="text-justify">Another problem noticed was during the crossings of streets. Knowing when the light is green for pedestrians is a crucial task that the VI users need to accomplish. Some users would depend on the sound of traffic moving while others would use the sound of other pedestrians. If APS was available, they would all turn to it. The problem arises when an intersection isn’t busy, as is the case in most suburban areas, when there is a lack of pedestrians and the APS technology isn’t present. Even when an intersection is busy, it could be very difficult to cross because of mapping issues. Turning to someone for help isn’t always desirable by the visually impaired person. </p>

					<h2>High-level Design</h2>

								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>Figure 1 depicts the overall high-level design of our proposed solution. Taking advantage of the already existing smartphone capabilities: GPS, camera and network connectivity, our system will be able to to fulfil user needs of orientation while crossing a streets intersection.</p> 

					<h4><b>Intersection Description Service</b></h3>
					<p>The Smartphone Application, while activated by users, will start streaming GPS coordinates and Orientation information to the Server-Side Component. When Location Services component detects user proximity to an intersection it will notify the Smartphone Application the distance to the intersection and a characterization of the intersection will be calculated and provided to the users using the Orientation information provided by the application (bearing, heading). There exists open source Maps APIs (eg: OpenStreetMap API) and also libraries capable of calculating navigation routes for cars, hence the required contextual information of traffic flow, traffic lights, etc can be calculated using these tools.</p>

					<h4><b>Traffic Light Detection</b></h4>
					<p>When requested by users -using a phone shake or an a screen slide gesture, the Smartphone Application will start capturing streamed images from the current user environment at the intersection. This stream will be transmitted to the Server-Side Component where the Computer Vision subsystem will trigger a traffic light status detection algorithm which will assist the user to determine appropriate instant to cross the intersection. There exist sufficient documentation on how to calculate the traffic light status using Computer Vision algorithms, there are also open source libraries available which provide already implemented capabilities for that purpose.</p>  

					<h4><b>Veering Detector</b></h4>
					<p>For those users where the Smartphone Application reports to have the Veering add-on integrated, the server will also calculate if the user is veering to either side of the walk-path using the Veering Detector component of the Computer Vision subsystem. When the user is detected to veer to either side, this component will notify the Smartphone Application which will appropriately generate the signal for correcting current user behavior reacting in the left or right arm devices.</p>
