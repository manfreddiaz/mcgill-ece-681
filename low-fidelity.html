							<h4>Starting the Application and Allowances</h4>
							<p class="text-justify">The application would start with a welcoming message and the affordances the user has with the smartphone directly. This includes showing how to skip a message, how to obtain information about an intersection and how to start the light detection and veering task. As explained above, these allowances will remain the same across both prototypes. </p>							
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h4><b>Prototype 1</b></h4>
							<p class="text-justify">The first low-fidelity prototype the team came up with explores the utilization of spatialized audio to render information about the intersection, voice to indicate the status of the light and audio feedback from each ear depending on which way the user is veering.</p>
							<h5>Intersection Mapping</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">The mapping was accomplished by having the reader of the intersection information move to the front of the person to render information relevant to both sides of the user’s body. Afterwards, if the parallel street was to the right of the user, the reader would jump to the user’s right and read the information (vice versa if it was on the left). Finally, the reader would jump in front of the user to read the information regarding the perpendicular street.</p>
							<h5>Light detection and Veering</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">Once the information above was read, the reader would stand in front of the user and inform them when the light turns green. Once they start walking, one team member stands on each side of the user. If veering is encountered, for example to the right, the person on the right would simulate a beeping sound to inform the user that they are veering to the right. This would continue until the user gets to the other side of the intersection.</p>

The hairband simulates the user wearing bone conduction headphones. We simulate the phone being worn around the neck with the net and rope shown. The phone in the image is turned off. It’s used to see if the user would understand which way they should swipe to obtain the information they require.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12">
							<h4><b>Prototype 2</b></h4>
							<p class="text-justify">The second low-fidelity prototype the team came up with explores the utilization of regular audio voice from the smartphone to render information about the intersection, regular audio voice to indicate the status of the light and haptic feedback from each wrist depending on which way the user is veering.</p>
							<h5>Intersection Mapping</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">The mapping of the intersection was accomplished by having the reader of the intersection information move to the front of the person to render all the information.</p>
							<h5>Light detection and Veering</h5>
							<p class="text-justify">Once the information above was read, two members of the Intersect-Assist team would be required to stand on each side of the user. When the light turns green, both of the members would simultaneously shake the user’s wrists. This would indicate the light has turned green and the person may commence crossing the intersection. Once they would start walking, if veering is encountered, for example to the right, the person on the right would shake the user’s right arm to indicate they are veering to the right and should correct their path. This would continue until the user gets to the other side of the intersection.</p>

					<h2>Summary of Test Results</h2>
					<p>The conducted test shed some light into several interesting results related to usability problems we initially had in our design concepts. First of all, there was one unintended misunderstanding related to the gestures (swipe up, swipe down) we proposed for activating our features. The assumption we had relied on the idea that those gestures mean the same for us as they do to the visually impaired community. As can be seen in the following video, those assumptions were incorrect.</p>

						<source src="./files/videos/usability-problem.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						Your browser does not support this video.
					</video>
					<p>Furthermore, the terminology for expressing the intersection description was not entirely accurate for informing our user of the actual traffic flow in each intersecting street. The relative position of the lanes is something we need to carefully consider when designing the messages for our system, imprecise terms could potentially lead users to dangerous situations that could otherwise be avoided.</p>
					<p>
						Also, although all the users considered the application information very helpful, they suggested some improvements related to their personal experience. One, is the ability to describe bike lane presence in a road composition, these lanes are considered a major challenge for the community. Another recommendation was related to the amount of information provided by the systems. The conducted research, even though could not had enough potential users, led to a general consensus that the amount of information should be controlled, the level of detail in the description should be sometimes precise, sometimes abundant. Due to the fact user may already be familiar with the setting that is being described, this is a setting all surveyed users agreed they should have a degree of control over.
					</p>
					<p>
						Related to the haptic vs spatialized audio feedback as a mechanism for veering correction, the survey did not brought any particular light onto which prototype is the preferred by the community. This may be an indicator that both form of providing veering feedback may be needing accordingly to users possibilities. The spatialize audio design is based on the existence of bone-conduction earphones which may not be in every user budget. However, one of the surveyed user that is used to employ such technology, do believe that the spatialized audio experience is better (familiar to APS, as you can see in the following video) than the haptic wrist band or bracelets.

					<p>
						Given all this, this early low-fidelity prototype usability test have led us to correct several major usability problems in our initial design that late-detected would undoubtedly harm the users’ feedback to our final solution.
